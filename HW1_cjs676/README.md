###Assignment 2
For this assignemnt I worked on my own and spent a great deal of time on google looking for solutions.  I was unable to work with others in the class due to travel outside the area. Working independently was a mistake that I will not repete. I think I spent a great deal of time searching for answers to easy questions about which I was confused. I've included the links to some of the guides I found helpful. 

1. I created the directory on compute following the directions provided by Dr. Bianco
2. In order to create the environmental variables I relyed on the following two webpages:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7501678/set-environment-variables-on-mac-os-x-lion

  I used nano as the text editor because that is what they used. It was fairly easy and I may use it again in the future. 

Below you will see the screenshot of the .bashrc file.

In order to get the screenshots into this document I follwed these two guides:
